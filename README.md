# Deploying an end-to-end chicken disease model into cloud server using Flask and Docker with CI/CD pipeline

This project focuses on the prediction of chicken diseases using an `end-to-end deep learning` approach, with the integration of `MLOps`, `DVC pipeline` , and `Azure` for deployments. The `pipeline` encompasses various stages, beginning with `data preprocessing`  and `feature extraction` from chicken health records. The deep learning model is `trained` on the processed data to predict the occurrence of chicken diseases accurately. Throughout the project, `MLOps` practices are employed to `track` and `log` experiments, including `model artifacts`, parameters, and metrics. The resulting model is then integrated into a web application, which is `containerized` using `Docker`. The final step involves `deploying` the application, along with the trained model, as a Docker container on Azure. The deployment process leverages `Azure`'s capabilities for `CI/CD integration`, `automated tests`, and `releases`, ensuring a robust and efficient management of the deployed chicken disease prediction system.

## Chicken Disease in Azure - Demo

_**Link**: Will be updated. Please check the `Disclaimer` below the screenshot for more !!!_

_**Disclaimer:**_ <br>
_1. This app is just a demo and not for realtime usage. The main objective is to get ML models into production in terms of deployment and CI/CD, from MLOps paradigm_. <br>
_2. Additionally, due to some technical issues in the Heroku backend, the app currently crashes, so the Heroku app link is not provided as of now. It will be updated once the issues are solved and when the app is up and running_.

## Motivation

`Deep learning/Machine learning` or `AI` (in short) is the current hot topic which has its application in most of the fields and it's demand is increasing day-by-day. But at this point, the sad truth is - `Only very less percentage of ML/DL models makes into production`. That's when `MLOps` comes into the picture. 

The major challenges with ML during development are:
  - Development, training and deployment environment can be different leading to dependency hassles.
  - Whenever input data changes, its becomes more tedious to reproduce the experiment.
  - Experiment tracking and analyzing can mostly be difficult and challenging.
  - Core ML code turn out to be spaghetti jungle which introduces lot of `boilerplate` codes.

MLOps is a budding field that productionalize ML models. `ML/DL` being a core research field, still misses out the `deployment` paradigm which includes design principles, patterns, testing, code styles etc. This restricts the domain to be used in the production environment efficiently. To nullify this, MLOps integrates DevOps principles into ML domain and serves as an intersection point of `Machine learning`, `Datascience` and `DevOps`.
